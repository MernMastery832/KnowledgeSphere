## My Contributions  
As a **Full Stack MERN Developer**, I contributed to both backend and frontend development to ensure **KnowledgeSphere** delivers a smooth and engaging e-learning experience. On the backend, I built **RESTful APIs** using **Node.js** and **Express.js**, integrating **MongoDB** for storing course content, user data, and assessments. I implemented **JWT-based authentication** with **role-based access**, ensuring secure interactions for students, instructors, and admins. Additionally, I set up **Cloudinary** for video and document storage and integrated **Firebase notifications** for real-time updates.  

On the frontend, I designed and developed **React components** using **Tailwind CSS**, creating an intuitive and visually appealing learning interface. I managed state efficiently with **Redux**, ensuring seamless updates for course progress, quizzes, and discussions. I also contributed to the **quiz system**, **certificate generation**, and **live Q&A features** to enhance interactivity. Collaborating with my team, I worked on **UI/UX improvements, database optimizations, and deployment**, ensuring **KnowledgeSphere** is scalable, secure, and user-friendly.
